VEHICLE REGISTRATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

POJECT DESCRIPTION
The Vehicle Registration Management System is a desktop-based software application designed to automate and manage the process of registering vehicles and Managing driving licences. The system aims to replace manual, paper-based registration processes with a computerized solution that is faster, more accurate, and easier to manage.
This system allows authorized users to record and maintain information related to vehicle owners, vehicle identification numbers, and driver licence in a centralized digital platform. By using this application, transport authorities or institutions can efficiently store, retrieve, and manage vehicle and licence data, reducing data loss, duplication, and human errors.
The application is developed using JavaFX, providing an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to perform operations such as registering new vehicles, Managing licences, viewing stored records, and managing user inputs through event-driven actions. The system improves service delivery. 


HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
The Vehicle Registration and Management System operates through a user-friendly graphical interface and follows these steps:

1. User Input
-The user enters required details such as
-Vehicle owner name
-Vehicle registration number
-Driving licence number
-Input is provided through text fields on the JavaFX interface.

3. Event Handling
-When the user clicks the Register button, an event handler is triggered.
-The system validates the entered information to ensure that no required field is left empty.

4. Data Processing 
-If validation is successful, the system processes the information and formats it appropriately.
-The data is then stored temporarily (or displayed) within the application interface.

6. Data Display
-Registered vehicle and licence details are displayed in an output area, allowing users to review the information immediately.

4. Form Management
-The Clear button allows users to reset all input fields for new entries.
-The Exit button safely closes the application.

6.  System Feedback
-If any input field is missing, the system displays an error message using alert dialogs.
-This ensures accuracy and guides users to correct mistakes.

KEY BENEFITS
-Reduces paperwork and manual record keeping
-Minimizes human errors
-Improves efficiency and speed of registration
